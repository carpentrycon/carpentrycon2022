  description: "25 August 2020: 14h00 UTC <br><br>Leadership skills such as openness, inclusivity, project road mapping, and community building are essential for modern science and research today. Despite this, these skills are rarely taught.<br>br>We believe that scientists and researchers should learn how to effectively lead projects openly, collaboratively, and thoughtfully from day one.To facilitate this, we created Open Life Science (<a href='http://openlifesci.org/'>http://openlifesci.org/</a>), a 16-week training and mentorship program that prepares early career researchers and academic leaders to become open science ambassadors for their own projects but for the communities around them.<br><br>In this session, we will discuss mentoring and training our members in Open Science skills, introduce to the Open Life Science (OLS) program's open source resources, and run a “taster session” where we will touch on some of the important aspects of open research, whilst giving it the feel of a collaborative, informative and classic OLS full-cohort call."

  description: "18 August 2020: 16h30 UTC <br><br>The issue of dependency management is one which is of interest to all scientists and researchers who wish to develop reproducible results with software. The Nix package management system is one which is cross-platform and will enable the instructors to pin their dependencies to mimic perfectly, the environment of the learners, as a very basic example see <a href='https://github.com/HaoZeke/nixCarp'>https://github.com/HaoZeke/nixCarp</a>. It is a more robust, secure and lightweight alternative to using a docker container and is a very important pedagogical tool as well. The workshop would cover the generation of nix-pkg derivations, which being written as they are in a functional style of programming, needs some description. Furthermore it would cover the best practices of the nix community when it comes to using the nix-shell environments. My experience as a nixpkg manager would let me communicate this tool to my fellow instructors and those at the event. I feel like this would be very beneficial to the audience. Nix, like git is a deep and complicated tool, but which can be used to reap fantastic dividends with a low learning curve if taught correctly."

  title: "Building institutional computational genomics capacity (de novo)"
  description: "22 July 2020: 10h00 UTC <br><br>There is a growing gap between the accumulation of big data and researchers’ knowledge about how to use it effectively. Furthermore, there seems to be great interest from the Carpentries community to learn and teach genomics. South Africa boasts 26 public universities each conducting research in areas where genomics techniques are (or can be) applied to answer questions related to health, food, environmental issues, and/or agriculture. Currently, only nine of these universities offer formal undergraduate or postgraduate training programmes in bioinformatics or computational genomics. The North-West University (NWU) isn't one of these nine. For that reason, we explored various avenues for building institutional genomics capacity. I would like to present this topic in the form of a breakout session at CarpentryCon@Home and discuss the results and challenges for each approach, as was experienced by our institution’s researchers. I would also like other people in the field of genomics to tells us how they build genomics capacity at their institutions. Together we might come up with feasible solutions to 'teach people how to fish'."

  title: "Make Your Tools, Scripts and Analyses Open and more FAIR"
  description: "30 July 2020: 12h00 UTC <br><br>Open science has rapidly gained interest and importance across the academic world and society. It will require researchers to be open and transparent in sharing their methods, analyses and raw and published data, so these can be reused, verified or reproduced by a wider audience. In the humanities and social sciences, research software (including code, scripts, tools, algorithms) often is an integral part of the methodological process, so there is a need for guidelines on making these open as well. The Netherlands eScience Center and DANS launched a website (fair-software.eu) with five practical recommendations that help researchers to make their software more FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable). The site serves as a signpost for researchers to get actionable advice on how to get this adventure started. The general idea of the session is that workshop participants bring their code, and the session organizers will help participants to improve the openness and FAIRness of their software or scripts using the new website as guidance.<br><br>Participants of this session will
  (i) learn about the fair-software.eu website, (ii) learn about five things they can do to improve FAIRness of their software, (iii) put their code in the open, (iv) select the license, (v) find relevant software registry, (vi) make their software citable and (vii) select the quality checklist that fits their purpose.
  <br>The session addresses the challenges in opening up research software and facilitation of software sustainability."

  title: "Growing Carpentries through a growing community"
  description: "20 July 2020: 17h00 UTC <br><br>Non-profits and volunteer led organizations are subject to a predictable lifecycle.  The early excitement of new ideas is generated by a small group.  This early energy is slowly replaced by growth and stability sustained by a larger group through creation of some form of governance and management.  Local Carpentries organizations are subject to the same constraints as other volunteer led groups.  One of the predictable problems as organizations mature is burnout or attrition of volunteers which, if not addressed, leads to a decline curve and ultimately dissolution of the local community.  We plan to describe the characteristics of the organizational lifecycle and our experiences implementing measures to encourage continued growth. <u>We will encourage both Carpentries volunteers and learners provide their viewpoints as we discuss the following</ul>:<br><br>
  - Where is your local Carpentries in the organizational lifecycle?  What are the characteristics that can determine whether your community is growing or has become stagnant?<br>
  - The best way to assess the health of the organization is to answer the question “Are we accomplishing our mission?”  Has your community clarified your mission? Who is your community?  Is it diverse or are there groups who are not well represented?  How can these groups contribute to the community and how can they be engaged? <br>
  - What is unique about Carpentries compared to other non-profit, volunteer led organizations?  Why will these characteristics make it harder or easier to create continued growth? <br>
  - After you have identified the characteristics of your community and clarified your mission, it is time to brainstorm some ways to renew and re-energize, moving from the mature or stagnant decline stage back to  healthy growth.  Newer communities can consider how to anticipate and plan for this stage of their lifecycle."

  description: "6 August 2020: 13h00 UTC <br><br>This session is a follow up to my recent talk: Low-Income Data Diaries - How “Low-Tech” Data Experiences Can Inspire Accessible Data Skills and Tool Design (<a href='https://youtu.be/XV_jxbB1cBY'>https://youtu.be/XV_jxbB1cBY</a>) at csv,conf,v5. In that csvconf.com talk, I made the case that a significant population of data stakeholders exist in low-technical skills and low-technological infrastructure context, and find current data literacy approaches (Data Literacy 1.0) inaccessible. The main takeaway from the csv,conf talk was the need to rethink and redesign a new approach (Data Literacy 2.0) that makes data skills and resources more accessible to these stakeholders. Whereas the prior talk set the stage for the current challenge, this session will dive into strategies and resources that I have discovered and develop to get started with embedding low-tech skills and resources into our data literacy approaches."

  description: "15 July 2020: 13h00 UTC<br><br>Generating insight and conclusions from scientific data is not always a straightforward process. Data is often hard to find, archived in difficult to use formats, poorly structured and/or incomplete. These issues create friction and make it difficult to use, publish and share data. The Frictionless Data initiative (frictionlessdata.io) at Open Knowledge Foundation (okfn.org) aims to reduce friction in working with data, with a goal to make it effortless to transport data among different tools and platforms for further analysis, and with an emphasis on reproducible research and open data. In this workshop, participants will learn about different sources of friction in working with scientific data and how to alleviate them using the open source Frictionless Data tools. Participants will learn where to find open scientific data, how to computationally prepare this data for further analysis and generate conclusions, and also best practices for sharing data and documenting metadata. This hands-on workshop is aimed for researchers interested in open science and reproducible research that are at a beginner programming level (for instance, some familiarity with Python or R and the command line), but more advanced programmers are also welcome."

Papers now include more and more supplementary materials. This shift has been facilitated by burgeoning technologies and available training. Another major contributor was the replication crisis in psychology. Nowadays, researchers customarily examine the extra materials with new studies. These materials are available to non-academics, too. Standard supplementals could be dubbed Open Data and Reproducibility, Version 1. Excitingly, updated features are already available, largely based on open-source software. Let’s look at some applications using R.<br><br>Pablo Bernabeu will conduct this workshop, which uses real code of varying complexity and Madisonian data!

  description: "27 July 2020: 18h00 UTC<br><br>Software Carpentry focuses on task automation and proposes Bash shell as an effective tool to this end. However, in Windows it is not a native tool and it can lead to problems with software designed primarily for Windows (many scriptable engineering packages are such). However, there exists a native tool with capabilities comparable to that of the shell. Learning how to effectively use the command prompt would provide attendees with a technical skill very interesting to the engineering community at large. This in turn would help grow the interest in The Carpentries workshops and, in a wider perspective, the diffusion of Open Science practices in the engineering community."

  title: "Building Text-as-Data Communities"
  description: "04 August 2020: 21h00 UTC<br><br>In this session we hope to bring together text-as-data practitioners and those in academic support roles to discuss models for building communities related to computational text analysis. Many early career scholars interested in text analytics find themselves at institutions that provide little direct support for learning and practicing emerging methods related to text as data (e.g., topic modeling or sentiment analysis). Even where expertise does exist on a particular campus, it can be difficult for an individual scholar —- especially those in the humanities or social sciences—to bridge disciplinary and bureaucratic boundaries to find peers and mentors in computational research areas. The Carpentries offer one helpful foundation for learning essential data science tools; this session explores opportunities for building upon that foundation to address the growing needs and interests of scholars in text analytics. <br><br>At our institution, we recently initiated the Text as Data Practice Group, a discipline-agnostic monthly gathering for scholars to experiment and learn from each other, from local experts, and from open access tutorials in a social setting. The group operates in the spirit of creating community, nurturing peer-to-peer learning, and exploring emerging text and data analysis methods on campus. We plan to provide an overview of this program, and then lead participants through discussion prompts to share their own thoughts about successes, challenges, and opportunities related to building communities for text as data. Participants will learn about different models to develop and nurture communities in computational research."

  - Discuss how to apply strategies for increasing belonging and engagement online to Carpentries workshops<br>
  - Analyze hypothetical scenarios and the factors that influence engagement and inclusion<br>
  - Share tools/features we have found useful for engaging learners online<br>
  - Identify a set of practices to adopt to your next online teaching experience<br><br>
  With the COVID-19 global pandemic and the shift to virtual learning, motivating learners to actively engage during our workshops requires the instructor to thoughtfully adapt their teaching approaches. In this breakout session, instructors will share their own challenges and successes with getting learners to connect to the material and one another while teaching programming remotely. First, we will dive into different principles of belonging and active learning, and brainstorm how best to apply these ideas to the online context. We will then work together to break down some hypothetical scenarios around online learning and propose new ways to address the needs/conflicts presented in each situation. Throughout this session, we will discuss the array of software tools available (e.g. Zoom, Canvas, Google docs) and how their features can be best leveraged to improve the learner experience. By attending this breakout session, participants will be able to interact with other instructors, share fresh teaching ideas, and reflect on their own teaching philosophy.<br>
  Engagement in this sprint will be based on note-taking and discussions in breakout rooms."

  title: "Addressing Learner Diversity and Belonging"
  description: "22 July 2020: 22h00 UTC<br><br>Learning Goals:<br>
  - Appreciate the diversity of learners and the importance of the affective aspect of learning<br>
  - Identify effective strategies for fostering community to improve learner belonging <br>
  - Outline categories of instructor talk and their potential effects on learner belonging <br>
  - Discuss activities and structural changes that leverage learners from different levels of preparation through differentiated instruction<br><br>
  In an era of social distancing, difficulties in creating an authentic feeling of connection and presence for online learners exacerbates already challenging hurdles to learner persistence in programming. A sense of belonging has long been known to influence learners and their intent to actively engage or even stay in a class. Feelings of belonging are often significantly lower in learners identifying with groups historically underrepresented in STEM. How can we continue to foster belonging even when we are separated by a screen? In this session, we will explore how we can intentionally craft and monitor the structure (e.g. modes of participation) and framing (e.g. instructor talk) of our online workshops to create a positive learning community. Importantly, we will dive into a commonly cited challenge, different background levels of preparation, and discuss ways to address this diversity in learners. Through a differentiated instruction framework, we can identify learner differences and provide flexible content/goals without establishing barriers or setting lower expectations. Through this session, participants will ultimately consider different building blocks for an equitable learning experience and identify small, meaningful steps to improving student belonging when they teach."

  title: "Online workshops - How to scale up your online workshop to reach 100 learners?"
  description: "26 August 2020: 10h00 UTC<br><br>In the CodeRefinery project we teach tools and practices for collaborative reproducible research software development, following the Carpentries style of teaching and workshop organization. Due to the outbreak of Covid-19, we were forced to cancel several in-person workshops planned in the spring 2020. As The Carpentries started piloting online workshops, we also shifted our gear to hold online workshops. After successful CodeRefinery online workshop with middle-sized cohort of participants (approximately 25 learners on average per day), we held a 'mega' CodeRefinery online workshop where we accepted 120 registrations as both learners and helpers.<br><br>In this panel session, we will present how we ran the workshops including small but critical tactics. (The current plan is that) Organizer, instructor, expert helper, helper, and learner, each of them will present their perspective and discuss our experiences and lessons learned. (Note: If it is difficult to have a panelist for any of the roles, we will try to summarize feedback from those who fall under the role and a lead or co-lead will present on their behalf). This session aims to reach audience that are interested in online workshops and scaling up community, regardless of their roles. We hope that our experiences will provide with some inspiration to the session participants for planning their organization of or participation in workshops.<br><br>We will use HackMD as a platform of questions and answers during the panel session and answer them in the QA session at the end. We used HackMD in the Mega CodeRefinery online workshop and thus hope we could demonstrate some advantages of using HackMD"

Subsequently the HPC Carpentry GitHub team was created and relevant existing material was repurposed and integrated into a single home. By mid 2020, development in the hpc-carpentry repos has stalled, with only a subset of the original goals met.<br><br>In Europe, there are at least two initiatives that have the potential to provide the human resources to refine and extend the teaching material, but with clear goals of their own derived from their own context. We would like to involve the community in a discussion on how to encourage and integrate such initiatives to help sustain the development of the existing material, and extend it to new topics.<br><br>For this, we propose a breakout session composed of<br>
  - a review of activity to date<br>
  - series of lightning talks by different stake holders<br>
  - an open discussion on how to move forward."

  description: "Code and data are important research output and integral to a full understanding of research findings and experimental approaches in a paper. However, traditional research articles seldom have these embedded in the manuscript’s narrative, but instead, leave them as 'supplementary materials', if they are openly available.<br><br>With Executable Research Articles (ERAs), eLife's vision is to enrich the traditional narrative of a research article with code, data and interactive figures that can be executed in the browser, downloaded and explored. It will give readers a direct insight into the methods, algorithms and key data behind the published research.<br><br>We realised that to incentivise authors to publish ERAs, we need to make this process of composing and publishing an ERA extremely easy and interoperable with existing authoring tools that our authors use.<br><br>In 3 minutes, I hope show one of the ways our authors can compose an ERA– we'd love to invite members of the Carpentries community to test our tool stack out and offer feedback."

The new virtual teaching environment is also reducing barriers to collaboration and opening up new opportunities for co-teaching across institutional and regional boundaries. These partnerships can be a way to reduce workshops costs and teaching burnout, and create more sustainable teaching and learning networks.<br><br>This breakout session will give librarians and library staff from academic, public, and special libraries a chance to share their successes collaborating on all kinds of Carpentries workshops.

  title: "Identifying Opportunities for Inclusive Language in Carpentries Workshops"
  description: "This lightning talk highlights the ongoing work being done among Carpentries instructors at Carnegie Mellon University Libraries to encourage inclusive language in data science and data management education. We expand upon existing training for Carpentries instructors which encourages us to avoid the use of “simple” and “easy” in our instruction, and offer additional considerations for inclusive language that is mindful of neurodiversity/neurodivergence, institutional access to resources, religion, and socioeconomic situations. “Best Practices” in data science and data management education often assume the researcher is operating at a baseline socioeconomic level, with access to certain institutional services, and having certain cognitive and physical abilities. Using a “calling in” approach, we identify opportunities within “Best Practices” to use compassionate language and considerations for accessibility. As a lightning talk, we will focus our three minutes on providing succinct examples of inclusive language opportunities, and provide the audience with information for learning more and getting involved in our efforts. <br><br>The target audience for this lightning talk is anyone who teaches (or hopes to teach) Carpentries workshops and wants to incorporate more inclusive language into their curriculum that is mindful of the many lenses through which a learner approaches their data science education. With this lightning talk, we hope to gather a network of interested individuals who would like to further collaborate with CMU Libraries on creating blueprints for more inclusive data science and data management education, as well as inspire current and future Carpentries instructors to use inclusive language in their workshops."

Because of the value placed on these gatherings, conference organizers have been reluctant during the pandemic to cancel scheduled meetings and instead have gone through great lengths to quickly pivot to online formats to continue to meet the needs of their community members. In moving to online platforms, conference organizers can no longer default to traditional in-person practices, which can be exclusive to participants who may already feel marginalized in their communities. Rather, organizers can be proactive about innovating inclusive conference practices.
