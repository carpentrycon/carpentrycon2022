                                    <p class="text-muted">Library Carpentry is software skills training aimed at the needs and requirements of library professionals. Training takes place in face-to-face workshops where one or more of the developed modules are taught. Modules are also made available online (CC BY, published via GitHub Pages) for self-directed study or for adaption and reuse by library professionals.</p>

                                    <p class="text-muted">A Library Carpentry workshop comprises one or more half-day, face-to-face sessions where one or more of the currently developed modules are taught. Ideally, 4 modules (e.g, Data Intro, Shell, Git, OpenRefine) will be taught in a workshop across four half-day sessions, but this is not mandatory. Organisers may prefer to teach the workshop over two or more days. While the original material is key, organisers may choose to swap in the SQL module to replace one of the core lessons, or teach it in addition. Workshops are interactive. Ideally attendees will bring their own laptop to workshop so that skills learnt can be replicated outside of the workshop without the need for additional setup.</p>
                                    <p class="text-muted">Workshops are run by a team. Ideally this will consist of:</p>
                                    <ul class="text-muted"><li>a Host (who is the principal local contact for the workshop)</li>
                                    <li>Instructors (who present the tutorials and lead the practical exercises)</li>
                                    <li>a Lead Instructor (who is in charge of deciding what will be taught by whom and ensuring the teaching aspects of the workshop go smoothly)</li>
                                    <li>Helpers (who provide assistance during practical sessions). Workshops can be any size.</li></ul>
                                    <p class="text-muted">To maintain the quality of Library Carpentry workshops, it is highly recommend that a Software/Data Carpentry certified instructor is present at each workshop.

Each module comprises 3-4 sections, is interactive, works across Windows, OS X, and Linux operating systems (with all setup instructions included) and has a combination of follow-my-leader sections and exercises (and additional exercises) that map to library practice. Modules introduce software and concepts relevant to librarians and have a preference for open source and widely used software. Data used in exercises is library-related, e.g. bibliographic data.</p>
